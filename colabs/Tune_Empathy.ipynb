I wanted to share some feedback with you that I received. I want to help you be able to advance in your career and I feel that this feedback will be helpful. I am excited that you are will to share your perspectives on the findings, however if you could focus on the data portion first, and highlight the main points, that would be really beneficial to your audience. By being more concise it will allow the potential customers and then CEO to focus on the facts of the report, which will allow them to make a decision for themselves. I understand that this is probably a newer to writing the reports, and I don't think that anyone has shown you an example of how the reports are usually written, so I have sent you some examples for you to review. I think that you are doing a good job learning and with this little tweak in the report writing you will be able to advance in your career. In order to help you, if you don't mind, I would like to review the report before you submit it and then we can work together to ensure it will be a great report. I understand that you really enjoy providing your perspectives on the technology and recommendations on how it can be used, so we will find a spot for that in the report as well, but perhaps in a different section. Thank you so much for your time today and I look forward to working with you. \",\n          \"Hi Jonathan, I hope you're having safe travels along your way. I'm reaching out to you because you are a valued employee, and we appreciate your hard work and research. While I understand you are passionate about these projects, it is imperative that you keep your reports concise, seeing as we are all continuously on a time crunch. Because these reports are not written as efficiently as possible, it is taking too much of our time to read and determine which bit of information is most valuable. I need you to shift the way you are writing these reports so that way we can maximize our work flow processes. We love having you on our team, but if you can not make these necessary changes, we may have to relocate your skill set to a different department. However, I am positive you can make these minor changes in the way you create your reports. Please research the formal way to write reports so that way you no longer add too much information. These reports should have less opinions, and more facts. I will also send some material for you to review on how to keep these reports business friendly. I love your passion and your drive, I am hoping we can continue to have you on this project. A few minor changes will be all it takes to get the ball rolling in the right direction! If you have any concerns, feel free to reach out to me and I will be more than happy to assist. Thank you, William\",\n          \"Dear Jonathan, I am writing to find out how things are going on the Beta project. I understand that you are enjoying the role and finding new applications.I have had some feedback from Terry confirming that you are doing well but there are some improvement points that I would like to discuss with you. It has been noted that your contributions are providing real value and they enjoy working with you, however, some of this value is spoiled by a conversational tone and being a bit verbose. In business correspondence it is essential that the facts are clear, concise and distinguishable from opinion, otherwise the message may be lost (regardless of how good it is).There are a number of significant reports required in the coming weeks. Please could you ensure that you confirm with Terry the exact detail and format required for specific reports and communication. He should be able to provide templates and guidance to ensure that his requirements are met. I would also recommend that you undertake a report-writing course, which should help you to ensure that you convey your great ideas in the best possible way.I am keen to support you to ensure the success of the project and your professional development. When I return in 2 weeks I would like to have a conference call with you and Terry to better understand how we can help you going forward.

As I am only in office today and you are on a travel, I am contacting you via Mail.I became a feedback from people related to your reports in the Beta project that I want to discuss with you. In general, the team is happy about your skills in contribution and espacially your way to identify improvements they may would have not seen. At first, your technical reports contain too much commentary that are not neccessary and make the report too long. Your ideas and thoughts about the technical solution are important, but you should only note them down separatly to discuss those with the project team, not to write them in the reports.Second is that your technical writing level is not on the level it is required to be. to presennt this to customer or our CEO. This requires that the colleagues are correcting your work  what leads due to the high pressure to delays, which is embarassingfor the colleagues who commited end dates.It might be that you will be removed out of the project team Beta because of this. This is not to blame you, we just need to be more efficient in this urgent stage to provide the reports.As I know you are an ambitious employee and you want to do the best. I am also sure you want to be developped in a way that you are getting a lead engineer.  To achieve this target, we need to work on your skills in writing technical reports to only note down the required information. Your technical skiills are already on the required level. In addition, the usiness writing is a topic that we can work on.At first we can agree that you send me each chapter that you finalized so that I can have a review before submitting all to Terry. In addition, we need to check for courses to strengthen you rskills in writing reports as I also want to continue working with you. I see a high potential, we need to sit together to develop you in right directions.I wish you a save travel back. If you have any questions or concerns you can always write or call me. Best Regards, William'"

Your experience is paying off as you are often finding improvements the product team did not even know they needed.  I wanted to share some feedback I got from one of your colleagues regarding your reports. Your enthusiasm for this project is infectious and I love to see this level of engagement. However, we also want to be mindful of the end users of the reports you are preparing. In these projects, deadlines often move at a fast pace. In order to ensure the project can stay on time, it is important to focus on inputting mainly facts when writing these reports. You offer a unique perspective and your insights are greatly appreciated. I would love to discuss your ideas with you in separate meetings outside of this project. I understand you are having to compile and organize a large amount of information. I appreciate how overwhelming this can feel at times. When these reports are completed, they are reviewed by our CEO and other key stakeholders. To ensure we are respecting their time, we want these reports to by concise and well organized. I would like you to set up some time with Terry to go over his approach to these reports and his writing style. Once I am back from assignment I will set up time to review how this meeting went and discuss other ideas you may have. I greatly appreciate your efforts on this project and positive attitude. With the above mentioned areas of opportunity, I know this project will continue to run smoothly. Thanks.\",\n          \"Hi Jonathan, First off i'd like to say i'm very pleased to see your enthusiasm towards your work with ABC-5, I appreciate your commitment to doing your best work for the company.I would like to offer some insight into your work that should assist you in achieving your goals. We all need to be continually improving to move forward and I believe I can provide you with some assistance in this area.In regards to your report writing, i'd like to to understand that although your reports cover a lot of good information, we need to keep in mind the target audience and the key objectives of the information. The people that read these need to be able to digest the critical points and understand the facts, so try to find the best way to make the information concise and strictly factual.In addition to this, reports are much more useful when the structure or flow of the report is orderly, it asissts the reader in understanding the information within and allows them to make informed decisions based on your data. It may be a good idea to ask your manager for training opportunities for report writing to develop your skills even further, and be sure to reguarly check in with your manager to make sure your work is aligned with the objectives of the team.I hope these points help you in your job. Please keep up the great work! Thank you!\",\n          \"Hello Jonathan, Thank you for your work on the Beta project.  I would like for us to set up a meeting to discuss your work on the project.

I appreciate you taking the time to send Terry a message about your upcoming report and I do love that you are enthusiastic about the project. You may not be aware but the Beta project reports are submitted to senior level management. These managers receive many reports and are super busy so they require us to provide data concisely as well as factually. For the report you are sending to Terry, I am requesting that you provide the most important info in 2 bullets and then have your amplifying information as well as additional thoughts noted as such,(e.g., What I found out.
