I wanted to share some feedback with you that I received. I want to help you be able to advance in your career and I feel that this feedback will be helpful. I am excited that you are will to share your perspectives on the findings, however if you could focus on the data portion first, and highlight the main points, that would be really beneficial to your audience. By being more concise it will allow the potential customers and then CEO to focus on the facts of the report, which will allow them to make a decision for themselves. I understand that this is probably a newer to writing the reports, and I don't think that anyone has shown you an example of how the reports are usually written, so I have sent you some examples for you to review. I think that you are doing a good job learning and with this little tweak in the report writing you will be able to advance in your career. In order to help you, if you don't mind, I would like to review the report before you submit it and then we can work together to ensure it will be a great report. I understand that you really enjoy providing your perspectives on the technology and recommendations on how it can be used, so we will find a spot for that in the report as well, but perhaps in a different section. Thank you so much for your time today and I look forward to working with you. \",\n          \"Hi Jonathan, I hope you're having safe travels along your way. I'm reaching out to you because you are a valued employee, and we appreciate your hard work and research. While I understand you are passionate about these projects, it is imperative that you keep your reports concise, seeing as we are all continuously on a time crunch. Because these reports are not written as efficiently as possible, it is taking too much of our time to read and determine which bit of information is most valuable. I need you to shift the way you are writing these reports so that way we can maximize our work flow processes. We love having you on our team, but if you can not make these necessary changes, we may have to relocate your skill set to a different department. However, I am positive you can make these minor changes in the way you create your reports. Please research the formal way to write reports so that way you no longer add too much information. These reports should have less opinions, and more facts. I will also send some material for you to review on how to keep these reports business friendly. I love your passion and your drive, I am hoping we can continue to have you on this project. A few minor changes will be all it takes to get the ball rolling in the right direction! If you have any concerns, feel free to reach out to me and I will be more than happy to assist. Thank you, William\",\n          \"Dear Jonathan, I am writing to find out how things are going on the Beta project. I understand that you are enjoying the role and finding new applications.I have had some feedback from Terry confirming that you are doing well but there are some improvement points that I would like to discuss with you. It has been noted that your contributions are providing real value and they enjoy working with you, however, some of this value is spoiled by a conversational tone and being a bit verbose. In business correspondence it is essential that the facts are clear, concise and distinguishable from opinion, otherwise the message may be lost (regardless of how good it is).There are a number of significant reports required in the coming weeks. Please could you ensure that you confirm with Terry the exact detail and format required for specific reports and communication. He should be able to provide templates and guidance to ensure that his requirements are met. I would also recommend that you undertake a report-writing course, which should help you to ensure that you convey your great ideas in the best possible way.I am keen to support you to ensure the success of the project and your professional development. When I return in 2 weeks I would like to have a conference call with you and Terry to better understand how we can help you going forward.

              "'Hello Jonathan, I hope you are doing well. As I am only in office today and you are on a travel, I am contacting you via Mail.I became a feedback from people related to your reports in the Beta project that I want to discuss with you. In general, the team is happy about your skills in contribution and espacially your way to identify improvements they may would have not seen. At first, your technical reports contain too much commentary that are not neccessary and make the report too long. Your ideas and thoughts about the technical solution are important, but you should only note them down separatly to discuss those with the project team, not to write them in the reports.Second is that your technical writing level is not on the level it is required to be. to presennt this to customer or our CEO. This requires that the colleagues are correcting your work  what leads due to the high pressure to delays, which is embarassingfor the colleagues who commited end dates.It might be that you will be removed out of the project team Beta because of this. This is not to blame you, we just need to be more efficient in this urgent stage to provide the reports.As I know you are an ambitious employee and you want to do the best. I am also sure you want to be developped in a way that you are getting a lead engineer.  To achieve this target, we need to work on your skills in writing technical reports to only note down the required information. Your technical skiills are already on the required level. In addition, the usiness writing is a topic that we can work on.At first we can agree that you send me each chapter that you finalized so that I can have a review before submitting all to Terry. In addition, we need to check for courses to strengthen you rskills in writing reports as I also want to continue working with you. I see a high potential, we need to sit together to develop you in right directions.I wish you a save travel back. If you have any questions or concerns you can always write or call me. Best Regards, William'"

This Beta project is key for the company, we need to success all together. In that respect, key priorities are to build concise reports and with strong business writing. Terry has been within the company for 5 years and is the best one to be consulted to upskill in these areas. Could you please liaise with him and get more quick wins from him. It will be very impactful in your career. We will discuss once I'm back about this sharing experience. I'm sure you will find a lot of benefits.

You have a key role in that project and the information you provide is critical for seniors to make decisions.In order for the process to flow more smoothly I need you to focus and limit your report to data and technical information. Recommendations and opinions could be sent to me on a weekely basis. Also, I would like to sit down and coach you on report writing when I am back. That will be a great development for your career.
